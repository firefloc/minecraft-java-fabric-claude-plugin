# The build + verify harness

A local Python harness that executes a `plan.toon` phase and mechanically
verifies it against the live server — **entirely outside the LLM context**. It is
the token-efficient path for static work: instead of `exec-worker` emitting
hundreds of in-context tool calls and `exec-inspect` issuing dozens of scan
calls, the harness POSTs everything to the server directly and returns one
compact digest.

The analogy is a test harness for builds:

| Build artifact | Harness role |
| --- | --- |
| `plan.toon` `steps` | the code |
| `plan.toon` `acceptance` + `quality_contract` | the assertions |
| `harness.py run` | the build step |
| `harness.py verify` | the test runner |
| the printed digest | the results |

It runs in **Claude Code** (where there's local Bash + Python), is **stdlib-only**
(no deps), and talks to the same MCP server over HTTP — reading the URL/auth from
`~/.claude.json` like `voxel/mcp_place.py` does.

## CLI

```sh
P="$PLUGIN_ROOT/tools/builder/harness.py"
python $P mode                              # dedicated vs single-player (gameTime test)
python $P selftest                          # write-readiness (forceload→set→read→restore)
python $P run    <plan.toon> <phase>        # execute a phase (force-load-bracketed)
python $P verify <plan.toon> <phase>        # run that phase's acceptance + contract checks
python $P build  <plan.toon> <phase>        # run, then verify  (the common case)
python $P perceivable                       # can a player at spawn see/reach the built elements?
python $P audit                             # flag registry `built` rows with no verify_token
```

Exit code `0` = everything attempted passed; `1` = any execution failure,
force-load miss, failed check, lint refusal, or perceivability/audit flag. The
calling skill branches on the exit code and reads the printed digest/report.

`run`/`build` take `--force` to override the terrain anti-pattern lint (below).
`perceivable` takes `--threshold N` (default 200 blocks) and `--spawn 'x y z'`.

## Pre-flight lint — the terrain anti-pattern gate

Before executing, `run`/`build` lint the phase. A phase is **organic terrain**
when it carries any **terrain op** (`columns`, `strata`, `fillbiome`, `scatter`,
`erode`) OR its project/element/step-notes read as terrain (canyon, mountain,
coastline, mesa, …). The harness is the **single terrain path** — terrain that
skips the gate never executes. A terrain phase is **refused** (exit 1) unless it:

- references an on-disk **`recipe.json`** (the plan's top-level `recipe` field
  whose file exists relative to the plan), so the field is re-derivable; and
- carries a **`verify_token`** (phase-level on a step, or plan-level) that
  `emit` stamps from `verify.offline_token(report)` only when the offline verify
  PASSed; and
- carries at least one `quality_contract` terrain row (`silhouette`,
  `edge_irregularity`, `block_mix_ratios`, `asymmetry`, `foundation_naturalised`,
  `water_continuity`).

A **footprint phase** (it lands a structure/foundation — a `place-structure`
step, a `foundation_naturalised` row, or an `erode` op with a `protect_box`) must
additionally carry a **`seam`** row `{a, b, max_step}`, which samples
`block_get_top_y` along the build↔world boundary and FAILs on a hard wall.

The phase is also refused if it is **stacked Y-banded rectangular slab-fills**
across ≥3 elevations that share edges or nest — the banned "ziggurat".

This is the machine backstop for the terrain method's first non-negotiable
(terrain-shape hard-rule 1): organic terrain must come from the heightmap recipe
or live sculpt, never a static stack of rectangles. A deliberately rectilinear
build (a plaza, a floor stack) is not classified as terrain and is not affected;
pass `--force` only if you are certain a flagged phase is not organic terrain.
See `$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/terrain/non-negotiables.md`.

## Terrain ops — the harness-executed landform path

`emit.emit_plan_toon` writes a phase whose steps carry generated landform as
sidecar JSON payloads (relative to the plan dir). The harness executes them with
a **count assertion** (a write that changes 0 blocks warns — a probable
force-load miss):

| op | payload | tool(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `columns` | one `block_fill_columns` plan (≤65,536 cols; emit pre-tiles) | `block_fill_columns` |
| `strata` | one `block_fill_columns_strata` plan | `block_fill_columns_strata` |
| `fillbiome` | a list of `level_fill_biome` arg dicts | `level_fill_biome` (per rect) |
| `scatter` | a list of placements | `level_place_features_batch` (≤4096/call) |
| `erode` | `{tool, args}` | `block_erode_region` (sync) or `block_erode_hydraulic_*` (start→poll→result) |

## Verify tokens — the `status:built` gate

On a **PASS** with at least one real check, `verify`/`build` print a
`VERIFY-TOKEN: vt_…` line. It is a content hash of the plan identity, phase, and
every check result — deterministic, so a real passing run always reproduces it.
Record it in the registry build row's `verify_token` cell: **`status:built` is
only legitimate with a token.** A phase that verified *nothing* (no acceptance
and no `quality_contract`) prints a "no token" note instead and must not be
marked built. `harness.py audit` reads the registry and flags every `built` row
whose `verify_token` is blank or malformed — a self-approved build that never
passed an independent verification.

## What it does

- **run** — executes every step of the phase in `seq` order, mapping each `op`
  to its MCP tool (`fill`→`block_fill_region`, `set`→`block_set_state`,
  `replace`, `clone`, `place-structure`→`structure_load_to_world`,
  `spawn`→`entity_summon`, `block-nbt`, `set-slot`→`inventory_set_slot`,
  `run`→`command_execute`). It **force-load-brackets** the phase (see below) and
  flags any write that changed 0 blocks as a probable force-load miss.
- **verify** — runs `acceptance` (coordinate→expected-block) and every applicable
  `quality_contract` row (`walkability`, `doors`, `headroom`, `block_mix_ratios`,
  `silhouette`, `edge_irregularity`, `connectivity`) using the sampling algorithms
  in `$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/exec-inspect/reference/contract-checks.md`, computing PASS / CORRECTIONS NEEDED
  / FAIL with the exact failing samples and the routing hint.

## Force-load envelope (dedicated/unattended servers)

`run`/`build` bracket the phase with `forceload add` … `forceload remove`,
because writes silently no-op in unloaded chunks when no player is online. The
envelope comes from the plan's `envelopes` metadata for that phase, else it is
derived from the phase's step coordinates. It is auto-**banded** to stay under the
vanilla **256-chunk per-dimension** cap (regions wider than that build in Z-bands,
one force-load at a time). Force-load is per-dimension; Nether/End work re-loads
in that dimension. The envelope is held through `verify`'s read-backs, then
released.

Declare envelopes in `plan.toon` so both the harness and the fallback `exec-worker`
know them:

```toon
envelopes[2]{phase,corner_a,corner_b}:
  1,118 -342,134 -328
  2,118 -342,134 -328
```

`corner_a`/`corner_b` are `x z` block coords (Y is irrelevant to force-loading).

### Re-asserting the protect set

When the build includes a **permanently force-loaded mechanism** (a self-running
rail loop, an automatic farm — chunks that must stay loaded so it ticks at 0
players), the per-phase `forceload remove` is a trap: `remove` takes a box, not a
set, so a band that overlaps the mechanism's chunks unloads them too. The
mechanism then stops — entities freeze and read as despawned to `entity_query`,
redstone reverts.

The harness guards against this. It reads a top-level `protect:` block in
`plan.toon` naming the chunk bands that must never go unloaded, and re-asserts
them with `forceload add` as the **last op of every force-toggling phase**
(`run`, `build`, `freshness`). So even when a phase's teardown removes its own
band, the protected bands come back loaded before the phase returns. The harness
never blanket-removes a range that covers a mechanism.

```toon
protect[1]{corner_a,corner_b}:
  -56 416,-40 432
```

Rows are `{corner_a, corner_b}` as `x z` block coords, same convention as
`envelopes`. The orchestrator owns this set (it tracks the mechanism's chunks);
the matching workflow rule — that no later phase may `forceload remove` a range
near mechanism chunks — lives in `reference/orchestration/coherence.md`.

## Graceful fallback

The harness is **opt-in**. If Python isn't available, the package is missing, or
a phase is unusually dynamic, `exec-worker` falls back to executing the steps as
in-context MCP tool calls (and force-loads the declared envelope manually). The
mechanical verification still applies — `exec-inspect` can run the same checks
in-context when the harness can't.

## What stays in the model

The harness does the deterministic, high-volume work. The model still owns:
**design** (the `design-*` and `exec-plan` skills), **freshness judgement** (is the plan stale
against current terrain? — `harness.py freshness` now samples a terrain phase's
planned column heights against the live `block_get_top_y` and flags drift, or
says plainly it cannot determine freshness for a non-terrain phase),
**failure diagnosis and routing** when a check fails in
a way the fixed routing table doesn't cover, and **perceptual judgement** — "does
it *look* right" — which no assertion captures and which stays with
`block_render_region` + user visual checkpoints. For a **ride-through /
walk-through** build that means an **iso + eye-level** render from the viewer's
height — never a top-down plan view, which hides the vertical faces a viewer
actually sees (the parks-loop "snow re-skin" and "blending done" both passed a
top-down look and were walls from the cart). And a render judged by the same
agent that placed the blocks is self-assessment, not verification — the gate is
an independent `exec-inspect` pass and a user visual checkpoint.

## Generated placement scripts — a third execution mode

The harness executes a `plan.toon` of discrete steps; `exec-worker` can also fall
back to in-context ops. There is a **third mode** for a form too large or too
parametric to be a single structure template or a tractable step list — a whole
continuous heightfield, a voxelized monument, a ring-spanning belt: **drive a
generated placement script.** Author the form as a parametric model (the
`terrain` / `voxel` toolkits), render-verify it offline, then place it with the
bundled paced placer:

```sh
python "$PLUGIN_ROOT/tools/voxel/mcp_place.py" place /abs/scratch/field_fills.json
```

`mcp_place.py` pages `block_fill_batch` under the 8192-entry cap, paces under the
~60 rpm limit, and backs off on HTTP 429. The authoring **script + model `.npy`
are the reusable, registry-worthy artifact** — record their location in the
registry exactly as for a structure template, since the form can be regenerated
and re-placed from them. A hand-rolled placer must replicate the pacing + 429
backoff (see `$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/execution/engine-limits.md` § Throughput).
