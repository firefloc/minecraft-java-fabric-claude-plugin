description: >-
  Orchestrates a populated place in a live Minecraft Java world — a village,
  town, city, district, or a building together with its grounds and context.
  Sequences layout, per-building design, transit, designed grounds, grading, and
  one integration pass, threading a shared architectural/material vocabulary and
  site datum so the place reads as ONE settlement rather than a patchwork of fine
  buildings that don't cohere. Tier-2 orchestrator.

# build-settlement (Tier-2 orchestrator)

You are a **specialty orchestrator** — a domain **playbook**, not a builder. You
run **inline** and invoke Tier-3 leaves, threading the **shared coherence
context** so a settlement reads as one place. Read
`$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/orchestration/coherence.md` and
`workflow-spine.md` first. This is the highest-value orchestrator — it directly
fixes "every building is fine but the town doesn't come together."

## What you own (the coherence context)

- **site datum + grade plan** — every building and the terrain work to it;
- **one architectural/material vocabulary** — a shared palette and style so the
  buildings read as one settlement (pass it into every `design-*` leaf);
- **the street/transit network** the buildings attach to;
- **one biome + scatter plan**, and **one integration pass** for the whole
  footprint.

## The playbook

1. **survey-site** — the real site, datum, biome.
2. **survey-research** — for a named/real settlement or a regional vernacular.
3. **exec-plan** — `plan.toon` with the coherence context in the header.
4. **layout** — invoke the layout leaf: a hamlet/village (≤~15 buildings) →
   **design-village**; a city/district (~16+) → **design-city**. It sets the
   street grid, zoning, and which landmark buildings exist.
5. **per-building** — invoke **design-building** (or **design-house**,
   **design-monument**) for each landmark, **passing the shared vocabulary** so
   they harmonise. Reuse vernacular building modules across the settlement.
6. **system-transit** — the roads/rail/paths connecting the buildings.
7. **design-grounds** — plazas, gardens, courtyards between buildings.
8. **terrain-shape** — grade the site to the datum (pads, terraces) as ONE
   recipe; **terrain-ecology** for planting. Verify gate (GATE A).
9. **exec-blueprint** → **exec-worker** (per phase, verified).
10. **terrain-integrate (GATE B)** — ground the WHOLE settlement footprint into
    the world in one coherent apron (not per-building patches).
11. **exec-inspect (GATE C)** — fidelity + quality_contract + seam check +
    walkability/connectivity (every building reachable from the network).
12. **register** (you, sole writer) → **exec-reflect**.

## Coherence reconciliation

Buildings↔vocabulary (shared palette/style), buildings↔terrain (pads match the
grade; foundations grounded by integrate, not trenched), building↔network (each
reachable). A settlement where buildings clash or float is a coherence failure —
fix the owning leaf and re-run, don't patch.
