  Step 4 of 4 of the Minecraft Java MCP setup. Register the running
  minecraft-java MCP server (the Fabric mod) with the active host — Claude Code
  or Claude Desktop, Codex, or Hermes Agent — so the Java world tools become
  available, then verify the connection with a live test call. Use when the user
  has the MCP server running and needs to connect their agent host to their
  Minecraft world.

# Connect your agent host to the Minecraft world (Step 4 of 4)

This is the **final** phase of the Minecraft Java MCP setup. It assumes Phase 3
(`setup-server`) is done: the mod is running and `/healthz` returns OK.

Before starting, get from the user:

- **The `/mcp` URL** — `http://<host>:<port>/mcp`, e.g.
  `http://localhost:8765/mcp`. Use `localhost` only if Claude runs on the same
  machine as Minecraft; otherwise the host's LAN IP or hostname. If the mod
  uses TLS, the scheme is `https`.
- **The bearer token** — only for a dedicated/remote setup (the token captured
  in Phase 3). A single-player localhost setup has **no token**.

> **Name the server `minecraft-java`.** The builder agent and skills in this
> plugin expect the MCP tools under that server name. Use exactly
> `minecraft-java` as the server name below — whatever prefix the host puts in
> front of the discovered tool name is the host's business (see the host table
> in `reference/runtime-portability.md`).

## One or two servers? (world + inspection)

The mod exposes **two** MCP servers from one jar. Connect whichever match the
user's setup:

- **`minecraft-java`** — the **world** server (read/write the world: `level_*`,
  `block_*`, `entity_*`, …). Runs wherever a Minecraft server runs — a dedicated
  server, or single-player's integrated server. Default `http://localhost:8765/mcp`.
  **Always connect this.**
- **`minecraft-java-client`** — the **inspection** server: SEE the world the way
  a player does. `view_capture` returns the player's actual first-person frame as
  a PNG; `sense_crosshair` / `sense_raycast` / `sense_entities` / `sense_screen` /
  `client_status` read client-side perception. Runs **inside a real, rendered
  client**. Default `http://localhost:8766/mcp`. Connect this **only when a real
  client is running** (see patterns below). Name it **exactly
  `minecraft-java-client`** — `exec-inspect` resolves that server's prefixed
  tools from whatever the active host discovered.

The three supported patterns:

| Pattern | What's running | Connect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Server-only** | a dedicated/headless server | `minecraft-java` only |
| **Client-only** | a single-player client (its integrated server runs too) | both — one process serves 8765 (world) + 8766 (inspection) |
| **Server + client combo** | a dedicated server + a separate client joined to it | both — `minecraft-java` on the server host:8765, `minecraft-java-client` on the client host:8766 |

The inspection server is **optional**: everything builds without it; it adds the
real-pixel "what does this look like in-game" check that `exec-inspect` uses when
present (and falls back to the synthetic `block_render_region` + a user screenshot
when absent).

Ask the user which agent host they are connecting, then follow the matching
branch below. Only the branch's own commands are host-specific; the verification
section afterwards is shared.

- **Claude branch** — Claude Code (CLI / IDE extension) or Claude Desktop.
- **Codex branch** — see `reference/mcp/codex-connection.md`.
- **Hermes Agent branch** — see `reference/mcp/hermes-connection.md`.

## Branch A — Claude Code

The mod speaks the **Streamable HTTP** transport, which Claude Code supports
natively. Use `claude mcp add`.

**Single-player / localhost (no token):**

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http minecraft-java "http://localhost:8765/mcp"
```

**Add the inspection server** when a real client is running (single-player, or a
client joined to the server) — see the patterns table above:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http minecraft-java-client "http://localhost:8766/mcp"
```

For a server+client combo, point each at its own host (the world server on the
dedicated host, the inspection server on the client host). Add a matching
`--header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` if that endpoint requires auth.

**Dedicated / remote (with token):**

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http minecraft-java "http://<host>:8765/mcp" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Pick a scope with `-s`: `local` (default, this project only), `project`
(shared via a committed `.mcp.json`), or `user` (all projects on this machine).
For a personal setup, `user` is usually what the user wants: `-s user`.

**Do not commit the token.** If the user wants project scope on a remote setup,
write `.mcp.json` with the token pulled from an environment variable instead of
inlining it. This plugin ships `.mcp.json.example` showing that pattern:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minecraft-java": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "${MINECRAFT_MCP_URL:-http://localhost:8765/mcp}",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${MINECRAFT_MCP_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

For localhost single-player, drop the `headers` block entirely — just the
`type` and `url` are needed.

After adding it, the user restarts Claude Code (or reloads the window in the
IDE extension). Confirm the server shows up with `claude mcp list` or `/mcp` —
it should report `minecraft-java` as connected.

## Branch B — Claude Desktop

Two options:

**A — Native custom connector (preferred, if the user's Claude Desktop has
it).** In **Settings → Connectors**, add a custom connector with the URL
`http://<host>:8765/mcp`. For a remote setup, add a header
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; for localhost, no header.

**B — Via the `mcp-remote` adapter.** Edit Claude Desktop's config file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Localhost (no token):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minecraft-java": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8765/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Remote (with token):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minecraft-java": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://<host>:8765/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The token goes through the `AUTH_HEADER` env var so its space (`Bearer <space>token`)
isn't mangled by argument parsing. Then **fully restart** Claude Desktop — the
tools appear under the tools (🔌) menu once it reconnects.

## Branch C — Codex

- Connection procedure, defaults and the remote/authenticated form:
  `reference/mcp/codex-connection.md`.
- Codex plugins provide the default local HTTP entries from
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; a remote or authenticated endpoint uses a bearer
  token that stays in an environment variable.
- Confirm with the host's own status command, then run the shared verification
  below.

## Branch D — Hermes Agent

- Full guide: `reference/mcp/hermes-connection.md` (skill discovery through
  `skills.external_dirs`, `mcp_servers` entries, remote/authenticated form).
- Confirm skill discovery with `hermes skills list --source local` — all 30.
- Confirm the servers with `hermes mcp list` and `hermes mcp test minecraft-java`,
  then run the shared verification below. Hermes prefixes the tools as
  `mcp__minecraft_java__*` and `mcp__minecraft_java_client__*`.

## Verify the connection

A registered server isn't a working one — confirm with a **live call**:

1. Make sure at least one world is loaded (and, ideally, a player is in it —
   many tools act relative to players or the world).
2. Call **`server_get_status`** — it needs no arguments and no player. A
   successful response (Minecraft version, TPS, online player count, loaded
   dimensions) means the chain is up: the active host → MCP server (the mod) →
   world. Then `level_get_info` with `dimension: "minecraft:overworld"`
   confirms world-level reads work.
3. As a visible smoke test, run `command_execute` with `say MCP connected` and
   confirm the user sees the message in the in-game chat.
4. **If you connected `minecraft-java-client`:** call **`client_status`** — it
   needs no arguments and confirms the inspection client is in a world (it
   reports `in_game`, position, facing). Then **`view_capture`** returns the
   player's first-person frame as an image the host can read. A successful
   capture means the real-pixel inspection path is live. (If `client_status`
   reports `in_game: false`, the client is on the title screen — join a world
   and retry.)
   `view_capture` defaults to `close_screen: true`, so it dismisses the pause/Esc
   menu that opens when you alt-tab and still returns a clean world frame; to stop
   that menu opening on focus loss at all, toggle Pause on Lost Focus off in-game
   with **F3 + P**. The client window must not be minimized (minimized = no
   rendering = no capture).

If a call fails:

- **Auth / 401** — wrong or missing token on a remote setup, or a stray space
  in the header. (`/healthz` works without auth, so a 401 on tool calls but a
  healthy `/healthz` points squarely at the token.)
- **Connection refused / timeout** — the mod isn't running (no world loaded /
  server down), wrong host:port, or a firewall between the host and the server.
- **Tools connect but calls error about no world / no player** — load a world
  and have a player join, then retry.

## Wrap up

Once `server_get_status` returns cleanly, the setup is complete:

- [ ] `minecraft-java` MCP server registered with the active host.
- [ ] Java tools (`level_*`, `block_*`, `entity_*`, …) visible.
- [ ] A live test call succeeded against the world.
- [ ] *(if a client is running)* `minecraft-java-client` registered; `client_status`
      and `view_capture` succeeded — the host can SEE the world as a player.
      Without a rendered client, record the setup as **server-only inspection**.

Tell the user they're done — all four phases are complete. Suggest next steps:

- Try a simple prompt: *"What's the time and weather? Set it to clear midday."*
- Try building: *"Build a small stone-brick house near the nearest player."*
  The host works through the Java MCP tools to plan and place blocks in the world.
