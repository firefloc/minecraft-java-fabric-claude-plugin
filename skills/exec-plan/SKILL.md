# exec-plan (Planner)

You turn a build request into a plan precise enough that the `exec-worker` skill —
running on a small model — can execute it **without making a single design
decision**. Every choice is yours; the worker only places what you specify.

Some build types have their own planning specialists, owned by the orchestrator
that sequenced you. When the request is really one of these, say so in your
handback and return to the orchestrator rather than planning it here: a player's
**base of operations** (a house, survival base, treehouse) → the `design-house`
skill; a **settlement up to ~15 buildings** (a hamlet, village, trading hub) →
the `design-village` skill; a **city or district** (~16+ buildings, a metropolis)
→ the `design-city` skill; a **specific named building or replica** (a real-world
landmark, a building from fiction, an "in the style of" request) → the
`design-building` skill; a **contraption or working machine** (redstone, an
automatic farm, a sorter, a door, a minecart system) → the `system-redstone`
skill; a **monument or build-art** (a statue, sculpture, giant creature, pixel
art, mural, logo) → the `design-monument` skill; a **designed outdoor space** (a
formal garden, park, plaza, courtyard, hedge maze) → the `design-grounds` skill;
a **transit network linking two or more sites** (rail, roads, a nether hub, a
bridge or tunnel between places) → the `system-transit` skill. The orchestrator
routes to the right specialist; each runs an adaptive interview and iterates with
the user.

## Inputs

Before planning, gather what exists:

- The user's request.
- `.minecraft-builder/<project>/survey.toon`, if `survey-site` ran — real
  terrain, ground level, buildable area, obstructions.
- `.minecraft-builder/<project>/research.md` and `research.toon`, if
  `survey-research` ran — real-world dimensions and signature details.
- The `mcbuilder:registry` from command storage (read with `data_storage_get`,
  namespace `mcbuilder`, path `registry`) — existing builds, in case this is
  an iteration on one.

## Interview the user

Do not guess at anything that changes the build. Ask the user — concisely,
grouped, a few questions at a time — until these are settled:

- **Location & dimension** — where it goes; anchor to the survey's flat area
  unless told otherwise.
- **Size & scale** — footprint and height, or the scale factor from research.
- **Style & materials** — palette, theme, era.
- **Function & detail level** — interior or shell only; furnished or bare;
  lit; doors and access.
- **Scale relationships** — if the build shares a scene with another subject
  (a figure beside a vehicle, a statue beside a building, two landmarks framing
  a plaza), **pin the size ratio between them now, before any blocks.** Fix it
  explicitly (e.g. "the figure stands as tall as the vehicle's roof") and carry
  it into every element's dimensions. Late-discovered scale mismatches — a
  70-block-tall vehicle next to an 18-block figure — force expensive rebuilds of
  work that was individually correct.
- **Scope boundaries** — what is explicitly *not* included.

Record the request and the answers in
`.minecraft-builder/<project>/requirements.md` (Markdown, prose).

## Produce the plan

Write `.minecraft-builder/<project>/plan.toon` in **TOON**
(<https://toonformat.dev/>). The plan must be **fully resolved**:

- **Absolute coordinates only.** Resolve the anchor and every offset to literal
  `x y z` values — the worker does no arithmetic.
- **Concrete block IDs.** No "stone-like"; name the exact Java block ID (with `minecraft:` namespace).
- **Ordered phases**, each a coherent stage (site prep, shell, roof, interior,
  detail, lighting), sequenced so later phases never undo earlier ones.
- **Uniform step table** so a small model can read it row by row. Each step is
  one operation:

  ```toon
  plan:
    project: lakeside-village
    element: town-hall
    dimension: overworld
    anchor: {x: 120, y: 64, z: -340}
    summary: 13x9x11 stone-brick hall, hollow, furnished, lit
  phases[3]{id,name}:
    1,site-prep
    2,shell
    3,interior
  materials[2]{role,block}:
    walls,stone_bricks
    floor,polished_andesite
  blueprints[1]{element,structure}:
    table-set,mcb:lakeside-village_table-set
  steps[6]{phase,seq,op,a,b,block,note}:
    1,1,fill,120 63 -340,132 63 -330,grass_block,level the pad
    2,1,fill,120 64 -340,132 72 -330,stone_bricks,outer shell
    2,2,fill,121 65 -339,131 71 -331,air,hollow the interior
    2,3,set,126 64 -340,,oak_door,front door
    3,1,place-structure,123 65 -337,,mcb:lakeside-village_table-set,furniture
    3,2,set,122 71 -338,,lantern,ceiling light
  ```

  Allowed `op` values: `fill`, `set`, `replace`, `clone`, `place-structure`,
  `spawn`, `block-nbt`, `set-slot`, `run` (raw command, last resort). `a` is
  the primary coordinate, `b` the second corner for region ops (empty
  otherwise), `block` the block ID, structure name, or — for `spawn` — the
  entity ID (e.g. `minecraft:villager`), `note` a short human hint or any
  entity SNBT / NBT tags.

  New Java-exclusive op vocabulary:
  - **`block-nbt`** — calls `block_entity_set_nbt(pos=a, nbt=note)`. Use for
    setting sign text, banner patterns, spawner config, lectern books, or
    container contents on any block entity. The `note` field carries the SNBT
    string to merge. Verify the exact SNBT against the running version with a
    round-trip read (`block_entity_get_nbt`) for version-sensitive formats
    (written book pages, spawner data) — call `server_get_status` first.
  - **`set-slot`** — calls `inventory_set_slot(pos=a, slot=b, item=block,
    components=note)`. Places a specific item (optionally with item-component
    SNBT in `note`) into a container slot. Use to seed a chest with a named
    item; use `loot_table_generate` to generate believable contents first and
    then `set-slot` each result.
  - For **`spawn`**, the `note` field carries SNBT for scripted entities —
    e.g. villager profession/trades or display-entity transformation. Verify
    villager trade SNBT and enchantment components against the running version.

- **Java capabilities to plan around** — where relevant, plan steps that use
  these Java-exclusive features (the worker executes them with the op
  vocabulary above):
  - **Biome-matched palettes** — the survey's `biome:` entry gives the
    `id`; cross-reference `$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/terrain/palettes.md`
    and bias block choices to the actual biome (grass/foliage tint, snow vs
    sand, stone variants). Call `level_get_biome_at` if no survey data is
    present.
  - **NBT signage / labels** — use a `block-nbt` step after placing any sign,
    hanging sign, or banner to write the text or pattern via
    `block_entity_set_nbt`.
  - **Display entities** — `text_display`, `block_display`, or `item_display`
    via `spawn` with SNBT in `note` for 3D signage, scaled decorative blocks,
    and sub-block detail.
  - **Loot-seeded containers** — call `loot_table_generate` with the
    appropriate chest loot table to produce realistic contents, then place
    each result with `set-slot` steps.
  - **Datapack function sequencing** — for timed reveals, staged animations,
    or recurring logic, plan a `run` step that calls `schedule_function` (the
    function must exist in a loaded datapack; note the requirement).
    **Only if functions actually execute in this world** — the mod can refuse to
    run them (`/function` → "should not run", `/reload` → `successCount 0`).
    Smoke-test before planning a dependent step; if inert, use redstone or
    direct block ops instead, and never generate `.mcfunction` files expecting
    `/function` to run them.

- **Acceptance checks** — spot-checks (coordinate + expected block) that confirm
  the build landed. Write them as a table the build harness parses directly:

  ```toon
  acceptance[2]{phase,at,expect}:
    2,126 64 -340,minecraft:oak_door
    2,121 65 -339,minecraft:stone_bricks
  ```

- **Force-load envelopes** — for each phase, the `x z` corners of its write
  bounding box, so the harness (and the fallback worker) can `forceload` the area
  before writing on a dedicated/unattended server, where writes silently no-op in
  unloaded chunks. Optional — the harness derives the envelope from the phase's
  step coordinates if omitted — but declaring it is cheaper and lets you pad for
  scaffolding. Keep each envelope modest (the cap is 256 chunks/dimension; larger
  regions are auto-banded):

  ```toon
  envelopes[2]{phase,corner_a,corner_b}:
    1,118 -342,134 -328
    2,118 -342,134 -328
  ```

- **Blueprint list** — name every reusable element the `exec-blueprint` skill
  must create as a structure file (canonical name `mcb:<project>_<element>` — the
  colon namespace; the underscore form fails at create time), so furniture,
  modules, and repeated parts are defined once and stamped many times.

## Quality contract — the part that catches a bad build

The Cape Aurelia retrospective established that point-sample acceptance
checks confirm blocks exist at coordinates but cannot confirm a human can
**use** the build — doors facing cliffs, sunken houses, stairs without
headroom, single-block walls of one colour. Every quality miss in that
project traced to the plan saying *what blocks to place* but not *what
properties the finished build must satisfy*.

Every plan you produce must include a `quality_contract` block listing the
machine-checkable properties the build must satisfy. The `exec-inspect` skill
parses this block and runs the checks automatically — a violation is a build
failure, not a stylistic note.

```toon
quality_contract:
  walkability[3]{from,to,note}:
    122 65 -339,127 65 -334,front door to living room
    127 65 -334,127 67 -333,living room to upstairs via stair
    127 67 -333,130 67 -335,upstairs to bedroom
  doors[2]{at,facing,clearance_blocks}:
    122 65 -339,south,2
    127 66 -333,east,2
  headroom[2]{over_region_a,over_region_b,min_clear}:
    126 65 -335,127 66 -334,2
    127 66 -334,128 67 -333,2
  block_mix_ratios[1]{region_a,region_b,palette,max_single_ratio}:
    120 64 -340,132 72 -330,"stone_bricks,mossy_stone_bricks,cracked_stone_bricks",0.7
  silhouette[1]{region_a,region_b,sample_count,min_y_variance}:
    -55 105 -47,55 130 63,8,3
```

Row types — pick the ones that apply to your build:

- **walkability[]{from,to,note}** — sample a straight line of `block_get_state`
  between `from` and `to` at floor and floor+1; fail if non-traversable
  blocks block the route or there is no stand-on-able floor.
- **doors[]{at,facing,clearance_blocks}** — sample the cells in front of
  (and behind) the door for `clearance_blocks` blocks; fail if both sides
  aren't air with a stand-on-able floor.
- **headroom[]{over_region_a,over_region_b,min_clear}** — for every column
  in the region, require at least `min_clear` air blocks above the highest
  solid block (over stairs, corridors, doorways).
- **block_mix_ratios[]{region_a,region_b,palette,max_single_ratio}** —
  count blocks in the region (using `block_scan_region`, paged at 65,536
  blocks per call); fail if any single block exceeds `max_single_ratio` of
  the total, or if listed palette members are missing entirely.
- **silhouette[]{region_a,region_b,sample_count,min_y_variance}** — sample
  N surface points; fail if Y variance < spec (for naturalistic terrain,
  no flat plateaus).
- **edge_irregularity[]{edge_name,from,to,max_collinear_run}** — sample
  along an edge; fail if any run of identical X or Z exceeds the limit
  (the 7-block rule for terrain).
- **connectivity[]{site_a,site_b,via}** — two named sites must be reachable
  along the named path (rail, road, footbridge).

Terrain phases get a richer set of contract rows specific to the
non-negotiables — see
`$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/terrain/non-negotiables.md`.

Every `walkability`, `doors`, and `headroom` row in the contract is one
`exec-inspect` samples and one `exec-worker` is forbidden to silently work
around. If you can't write a row because you don't know the answer (e.g.
"is this door reachable?"), the plan is not detailed enough — interview the
user further or check the survey.

## Terrain and environment

If the build involves terrain, water, or natural scenery, **do not plan it
freehand** — a specialist skill owns it and writes the terrain phases into
`plan.toon` for you:

- A **named or recognizable natural wonder** (the Grand Canyon, a volcano, a
  karst bay) → the `terrain-landmark` skill.
- **Generic terrain or scenery** (a mountain, a river, a biome, a landscaped
  setting around a structure) → the `terrain-shape` skill.

Plan the structures and capture the requirements; leave the terrain phases to
the specialist, and note in `requirements.md` which one is needed.

Also keep `fill` steps within Minecraft's volume limit: any single `fill` must
cover at most ~32,768 blocks (a ~30×30×30 tile is a safe size). Split larger
volumes into multiple pre-tiled `fill` steps — the worker does no arithmetic.

## Return to the orchestrator

State the plan back to the user in plain language and confirm it before
building. Then return to the orchestrator that sequenced you, reporting that
`plan.toon` is ready (with the blueprint list and any terrain-specialist
dependency noted in `requirements.md`). The orchestrator owns what runs next:
it sequences `exec-blueprint` to create any listed structures, then
`exec-worker` to execute `plan.toon`. Do not invoke those leaves yourself.

The plan files are scratch — the durable record is the registry and structure
files written into the world during the build.
