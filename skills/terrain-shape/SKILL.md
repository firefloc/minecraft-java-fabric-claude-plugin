  Authors naturalistic terrain in a live Minecraft Java world — mountains,
  valleys, hills, rivers, lakes, coastlines, islands, plateaus — as one
  continuous sampler-graph recipe, verifies it offline, and emits executable
  phases. Produces eroded, mask-materialized, biome-blended terrain that reads as
  real, never stacked rectangles or terraced ziggurats. Tier-3 leaf, invoked by
  the build-* orchestrators (was: terraforming).

# terrain-shape (Tier-3 leaf)

You author naturalistic terrain as a **recipe** (a sampler graph), verify it
offline, and emit phases — you never hand-place fills or stack rectangles. You are
a forked leaf driving `$PLUGIN_ROOT/tools/terrain`. Read
`$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/terrain/method.md` (the pipeline) and
`toolkit-api.md` (the API). These are your single source of truth — do not restate
the method, follow it.

## The method (see method.md)

```
recipe (sampler graph) → HeightField.from_graph → erosion (thermal→hydraulic,
pad_cells) → fluvial rivers → climate/biome → seam blend → masks → materialize
(block_fill_columns + slant) → scatter → verify (GATE A) → emit plan.toon phases
```

Use `terrain.emit.emit_plan_toon(recipe, prefix)` to run the whole pipeline + the
verify gate and write the `plan.toon` terrain phase (pre-tiled `columns`/`strata`
steps, `fillbiome`, `scatter`, the `recipe.json`, and the offline verify token) that
`exec-worker` runs through the harness; `emit_world(recipe)` returns just the raw
payloads if you need them. `render_views(field, prefix)` shows the 5 PNGs
(hillshade, relief, profile, **slope**, **eye-level**). Fix the recipe, not the blocks.

## Non-negotiables (the verify gate enforces these — HALT on fail)

1. **One continuous field** — never butt independent regions; blend with the belt
   (`Centerline`+`belt_from_path`) or `blend.sparse_convolution_blend`. A seam is
   a SHAPE problem; a colour pass cannot fix it.
2. **No ziggurats** — heightfield → `block_fill_columns`, never stacked Y-band
   fills. The verify gate detects and rejects terracing.
3. **Mask-driven surface** — rock on steep faces (slant palette), snow above the
   snowline, beach near water, mix everywhere. No monoculture.
4. **Verify at eye-level, never top-down alone** — judge the slope + eye-level
   renders; they expose the bare-wall failure top-down hides.
5. **Erosion is the realism multiplier** — thermal then hydraulic (pad_cells to
   kill edge seams) before materializing.
6. **Save the recipe** — persist `recipe.json`; a re-sculpt edits one node and
   re-evaluates, never discards detail.

## Contract with the orchestrator

Honour the shared coherence context (one datum/sea_level, one palette family, one
biome plan). Write `terrain/<element>.recipe.json`, the verified terrain phases
into `plan.toon` (`columns`/`strata`/`fillbiome`/`scatter` ops), and the
`quality_contract` rows from `$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/terrain/validation.md`.
Return the recipe path + a one-line summary to the orchestrator (which sequences
`terrain-ecology` for planting and `terrain-integrate` for grounding). Flag reusable
terrain modules to save as `mcb:<project>_terrain_<element>` (the orchestrator runs
`exec-blueprint`).
