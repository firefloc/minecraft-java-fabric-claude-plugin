# Skill Taxonomy

The 30 skills of the minecraft-builder plugin, grouped by prefix namespace and
tier. Plugin skills are discovered flat (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`); the prefix is
the namespace convention (they group in the `/` menu). The three-tier
orchestration model and the no-trivial routing rule are in
`../reference/orchestration/workflow-spine.md` and the `minecraft-builder` agent.

## Tiers

- **Tier 1** — the `minecraft-builder` *agent* (not a skill): routes every request
  to exactly one Tier-2 orchestrator; owns state, registry, gates.
- **Tier 2** — specialty **orchestrator** skills (`build-*`): inline (main-thread)
  domain playbooks that sequence Tier-3 leaves and thread the shared coherence
  context. Full coverage — every request maps to exactly one.
- **Tier 3** — **leaf** specialists: forked, single-purpose, return a result.

## Runtime portability

The `model / context` column below is Claude Code compatibility metadata, not a
model requirement for Codex. Codex maps the workflow to the logical roles in
`reference/runtime-portability.md`: `lead` for routing/design/planning,
`specialist` for research/inspection/blueprint work, `executor` for bounded
mechanical work, and `host-default` for setup. Codex uses its configured model
and native subagents when available; it runs delegated work sequentially when
that facility is unavailable.

## The skills

| Skill | Group | Tier | model / context (Claude compatibility) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| minecraft-builder | adapter | 1 | host-default / inline | Codex entrypoint that reuses the existing builder agent and shared spine |
| minecraft-mcp-setup | adapter | setup | host-default / inline | Codex entrypoint that reuses the existing four setup phases |
| build-natural-world | build | 2 | opus / inline | Orchestrates terrain/landscape/wonder/cave regions |

| system-transit | system | 3 | opus / inline | Rail/road/nether-hub/bridge networks |
| exec-plan | exec | 3 | opus / inline | Requirements → plan.toon (was planner) |
| exec-blueprint | exec | 3 | sonnet / fork | Reusable mcb:* structure templates (was blueprinter) |
| exec-worker | exec | 3 | haiku / fork | Executes plan.toon via the harness (was worker) |
| exec-inspect | exec | 3 | sonnet / fork | Verifies each phase + seam check (GATE C; was inspector) |
| exec-reflect | exec | 3 | sonnet / fork | Drafts process lessons (was philosopher) |
| setup-fabric | setup | — | inherit / inline | Install Minecraft + Fabric (setup stack) |
| setup-mod | setup | — | inherit / inline | Install the MCP mod + Fabric API (was install-mcp-mod) |
| setup-server | setup | — | inherit / inline | Configure & launch the MCP server (was setup-mcp-server) |
| setup-connect | setup | — | inherit / inline | Register the server with the active host (was connect-claude) |

## Routing table (primary intent → Tier-2 orchestrator)

| Primary intent | Orchestrator |
|---|---|
| terrain, landform, biome, water, natural scenery, named natural wonder, caves | build-natural-world |
| village, city, district, town, a building **with grounds/context** | build-settlement |
| one named/standalone building, replica, statue/monument, player house, bridge-as-object | build-structure |
| redstone, farm, contraption, transit line, nether hub, mechanism | build-systems |

Cross-domain → route by primary intent (one inline orchestrator at a time; no
nested forking). There is **no trivial/inline path** — every request runs the full
gated pipeline, depth-scaled.

## Setup stack

The four `setup-*` skills are run in order by the separate `minecraft-mcp-setup`
agent (setup-fabric → setup-mod → setup-server → setup-connect), not by the
`minecraft-builder` build pipeline.

## Future skills (flagged, not built)

None outstanding for the build pipeline — `terrain-cave` (designed subterranean)
and `terrain-ecology` (planting) are now real skills. A `build-scene` orchestrator
was considered and folded into `build-structure`; split it out only if
build-structure grows too heavy.
