# exec-blueprint (Blueprinter)

You create the **reusable structure library** for a build. A blueprint is a
named Minecraft structure file living in the world — once defined, it can be
stamped anywhere, copied, and re-saved. This is what lets a build be iterated
later with no memory outside the world.

## Connection

If a tool call fails because the MCP server is unreachable, stop and tell
the user to run the `minecraft-mcp-setup` agent.

## Inputs

- `.minecraft-builder/<project>/plan.toon` — its `blueprints` list names every
  reusable element you must define.
- `research.toon` — dimensions and materials, if a real reference is involved.
- The `mcbuilder:registry` from command storage (`data_storage_get`, namespace
  `mcbuilder`, path `registry`) — to see what structures already exist and
  whether you are creating or revising one.

## Naming

Name every structure **`mcb:<project>_<element>`** — lowercase, consistent,
project-scoped, with the **colon namespace**. This is the canonical form
across the whole plugin: in `plan.toon`, in `mcbuilder:registry`, and in
every `structure_*` call.

Always use the `mcb:` namespace. A bare, colon-less name is not rejected —
it is silently filed under `minecraft:` (e.g. `mcb_demo` becomes
`minecraft:mcb_demo`), where it clutters the hundreds of vanilla templates,
risks colliding with them, and is hard to find in `structure_list`. The `mcb:`
namespace keeps the build's templates isolated and listable. Treat the colon
as required, and keep the form identical in `plan.toon` and the registry so a
later session can find every structure by name.

## Create each blueprint

For every element in the plan's `blueprints` list:

1. **Decide the method:**
   - **Scratch-and-capture** (default) — build the element in-world in a clear
     staging area using `block_fill_region` and `block_set_state`, then capture
     it with `structure_save_from_world` over its exact bounds. Clear the
     staging area afterward. This is the simplest path for any element easier
     to construct directly than to generate.
   - **Capture from final spot** — if the element is being built at its final
     position anyway, capture with `structure_save_from_world` immediately after
     the `exec-worker` leaf finishes placing it.
   - **Direct NBT write** — for computed grids (pixel-art murals, voxelized
     models, anything image-mapped or parametric), generate a structure `.nbt`
     and write it with `structure_file_write` (content is base64). Heavier —
     only use when a script already produces NBT. See
     `$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/exec-blueprint/reference/generated-structures.md`.
2. Build it from the plan's exact materials and dimensions.
3. Save it under the `mcb:<project>_<element>` name. Java structure templates
   are saved as `.nbt` files under `<world>/generated/<namespace>/structures/`.
4. Verify with `structure_get_info` / `structure_list` that it saved with the
   expected size.

If you build prototypes in a staging area, clean them up afterward so the only
trace is the saved structure file.

## Iteration

To revise an existing blueprint: `structure_load_to_world` it into a staging
area, edit the blocks, capture it again under the **same name** with
`structure_save_from_world` (bumping its revision in the registry). Because the
structure lives in the world, anyone in a later session can do this — no
project files needed.

### Java-exclusive: structure placement options

When stamping with `structure_load_to_world` (for iteration or for the
`exec-worker` leaf's `place-structure` op), use the exact enum strings:

- **`rotation`** ∈ {`none`, `clockwise_90`, `180`, `counterclockwise_90`} — never bare numbers or "90 degrees".
- **`mirror`** ∈ {`none`, `front_back`, `left_right`}.
- **`integrity`** — float 0..1; `1.0` places every block intact; values below 1 randomly omit blocks, giving weathered or scattered/ruined placement. Useful for pre-aged ruins and naturalistic scattering.
- **`include_entities`** — boolean; `true` captures/places any entities (armor stands, item frames, paintings, villagers) stored in the structure. Set `false` when stamping structural geometry only.

## Register — report it, do not write it

The **orchestrator owns the `mcbuilder:registry`** and is its sole writer. Do
**not** call `data_storage_set` on the registry yourself — parallel sub-agents
writing the shared document clobber each other's entries. Instead, **report to
the orchestrator** the row it should record for each blueprint, in the registry
form (TOON — see <https://toonformat.dev/>):

```toon
builds[1]{project,element,structure,x,y,z,status,revision}:
  lakeside-village,table-set,mcb:lakeside-village_table-set,0,0,0,blueprint,1
```

Use `status: blueprint` for a defined-but-not-yet-placed structure; the
orchestrator updates it to `built` with real coordinates once the `exec-worker`
leaf stamps it. Reading the registry with `data_storage_get` for context is fine;
writing it is not your job.

**Confirm persistence before handing off.** A blueprint phase that "ran" but
left no `.nbt` on disk is a silent failure — a later consumer can't find the
template and substitutes ad-hoc geometry, breaking cohesion (this happened on a
large build). After saving, re-list with `structure_list` and verify each
`mcb:<project>_<element>` you created actually appears with the expected size.
Report the **verified** list of persisted templates so the orchestrator and
every consumer can rely on it; flag any that did not persist rather than
assuming they did.

## Return to the orchestrator

Return the structure names you created or revised and their sizes to the
orchestrator. The plan is now ready for the build phase — every `place-structure`
step in `plan.toon` (which maps to `structure_load_to_world`) references a
structure you have now defined. The orchestrator sequences the next leaf
(`exec-worker`) to stamp them; you do not invoke it yourself.
