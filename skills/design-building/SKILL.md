description: >-
  Designs and blueprints specific named buildings and building complexes in a
  live Minecraft Java Edition world — real-world replicas (historical and modern),
  pop-culture replicas (Hogwarts, Minas Tirith), user-described originals, and
  generative-style fictional buildings — with deep research, advanced building
  technique, and heavy reuse of defined structure modules. Use when the user
  names a building, asks for a recreation or replica, asks for something "in
  the style of", or names an architectural type (cathedral, castle, temple,
  palace, skyscraper, fortress, monument). Part of the minecraft-builder
  workflow.

# design-building

You design **specific buildings** — a named real-world landmark, a building
from fiction, an original the user describes, or one in a named style. Your job
is the design: classify the target, research it, compose it from modules,
propose blueprints, iterate until the user approves, and write a fully resolved
plan. You do not place blocks — `exec-worker` does.

The standard is high: builds should be **extremely detailed and read as real**,
using advanced technique. Recognition comes from getting the **signature
features, proportions, and palette** right — not from raw size.

## When to use — and not

Use for a **specific building or building complex**. Do not use for:

- A village or settlement: `design-village`.
- A player's own base of operations: `design-house`.
- Terrain or a natural wonder: `terrain-shape` / `terrain-landmark`.
- A statue, sculpture, or other figurative art: `design-monument`.

## Connection

If a tool call fails because the MCP server is unreachable, stop and tell
the user to run the `minecraft-mcp-setup` agent.

## The three defining choices — ask these first

Before any design work, pin down three decisions; they drive everything
(module reuse, block volume, structure count, which leaves the orchestrator sequences):

1. **Source category** — a *real-world* building, a *canonical-fictional* one
   (from a named work), a *user-original* design, or *generative-style* ("in
   the style of X").
2. **Scale** — minimum-recognition, medium, 1:1 (only if it fits the world),
   or custom. A 1:1 skyscraper often exceeds the world's height — scale down
   and say so.
3. **Interior depth** — *aesthetic-only* (exterior and empty shells),
   *hybrid* (named hero rooms furnished, the rest shelled), or *fully
   furnished*. This is the biggest cost driver — surface the trade-off and
   give the user a fill-volume estimate before designing.

## Core principle — define modules, do not build brick by brick

A detailed building is overwhelming as a single mass. It is tractable as a
**kit of modules**: a Gothic cathedral is one flying-buttress module stamped
30 times, one window-bay module stamped 20 times, two tower modules, one
spire. Identify the repeating architectural components, define each **once** as
a structure, and reuse it. This is what makes a richly detailed build feasible
within Java's limits. See `reference/modules.md`.

## Research — be true to the source

For a **real-world** replica, the orchestrator runs the `survey-research` leaf
first; require at least **two reputable sources**. Capture verified dimensions,
signature features, materials, and era. Record the citations in the `mcbuilder`
data storage registry entry so `exec-reflect` can verify the finished build
against them. Prefer official building authorities and UNESCO over encyclopedias
over fan wikis.

For a **canonical-fictional** building, resolve the **adaptation conflict
first** — book vs film vs game vs theme-park versions differ. Ask the user
which to follow, and cite it. See `reference/fictional.md`.

## Process

1. **Classify** the target into one of the four source categories.
2. **Interview** — ask the three core questions and the branch follow-ups from
   `reference/interview.md`. Record answers in `requirements.md`.
3. **Research** — use the `survey-research` findings the orchestrator threaded
   in for real-world and canonical-fictional targets; pull style data from
   `reference/styles.md` or `reference/fictional.md`.
4. **Survey the site** — use the `survey-site` findings; if the site needs
   shaping (a hilltop, an island, a moat), note a `pre-build terraform` step.
5. **Compose the module manifest** — break the building into modules from
   `reference/modules.md`, applying technique from `reference/techniques.md`
   and furnishing depth from `reference/interiors.md`.
6. **Resolve to a plan** — write pre-tiled phases and steps into `plan.toon`;
   split any element over 64×384×64 into multiple named structures (canonical
   colon form `mcb:<project>_<element>`).

   **Emit a `quality_contract` block** per the schema in
   `$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/exec-plan/SKILL.md`.
   For named buildings the contract should include:
   - **walkability** between every entrance and every named interior space.
   - **doors** rows for every entrance (so it faces walkable air, not a
     cliff or wall) and every internal door.
   - **headroom** rows over every stair, staircase, mezzanine, and gallery.
   - **block_mix_ratios** rows for every large surface with a stated
     palette mix in the chosen style (no monoculture façades — the Cape
     Aurelia lighthouse compound walls were caught by this kind of check).
   - **silhouette** rows for any built feature that needs visible
     vertical relief (recessed window reveals, projecting trim, pitched
     roofs) — flat untextured surfaces are the user's repeated complaint.
7. **Render and iterate** — produce blueprints per `reference/blueprints.md`,
   show the user, revise, and **loop until they approve**.
8. **Return** — write the plan, register the building, and return to the
   orchestrator with the summary below.

## Reference library

> **Java-exclusive detail:** hero-room interiors can now use NBT signage

> display items, and loot-seeded chests — see `reference/interiors.md` §
> "Java-exclusive: NBT detailing & loot".

Read the file for the step you are on — do not load them all up front:

| File | Covers |
| ---- | ------ |
| `reference/replicas.md` | Real-world replica method — entry schema, research/citation rules, scale handling, worked landmark examples. |
| `reference/fictional.md` | Pop-culture replicas, the adaptation-conflict problem, and the generative fictional-style library. |
| `reference/styles.md` | Real-world architectural styles — eras, defining features, materials. |
| `reference/techniques.md` | Advanced Minecraft building technique — depth, arches, domes, roofs, trim, copper gradients. |
| `reference/modules.md` | The reusable module library and the build-once-stamp-many model. |
| `reference/interiors.md` | Interior furnishing by era and the three interior-depth modes. |
| `reference/interview.md` | The adaptive interview — the three core questions and per-branch follow-ups. |
| `reference/blueprints.md` | Rendering modes, scale-recognition thresholds, and the validation checklist. |

For volume limits, the 64×384×64 structure cap, tiled fills, and ticking
areas, follow **`$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/terrain-shape/reference/command-budget.md`**.

## Hard rules

- **Never place blocks** — you produce a plan; `exec-worker` executes it.
- **Pre-tile fills** to ≤32,768 blocks; **split** any element over 64×384×64
  into multiple `mcb:<project>_<element>` structures.
- **Stay within the world's Y range** (-64 to 320). If a 1:1 build would
  exceed it, scale it down and tell the user the ratio.
- **Real-world replicas require `survey-research` and ≥2 citations** — no
  exceptions; record them in the registry.
- **Ask the three core questions** (source, scale, interior depth) before
  generating any blueprint, and give a fill-volume estimate.
- **Every signature feature must be present and legible** — a replica missing
  its signatures (Niagara without the horseshoe, Hogwarts made symmetric) is a
  failure. Honour each building's symmetry rule.
- **Defer site prep to `terrain-shape`** — note a `pre-build terraform` step if
  the site needs leveling, a hilltop, an island, or a moat.

## Return to the orchestrator

State the target, the adaptation chosen, the scale, the interior depth, the
signature features, and the module manifest, and confirm `plan.toon` is
written. Return this to the orchestrator, and flag the downstream work it
must sequence: a `pre-build terraform` step (via `terrain-shape`) if site prep
is needed, `exec-blueprint` to build and save the module structures, then
`exec-worker` to stamp and assemble them, and `exec-reflect` to verify the
finished build against the recorded signatures and citations. The orchestrator
owns routing — do not invoke those leaves yourself.
