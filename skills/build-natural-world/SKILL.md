description: >-
  Orchestrates a primarily-natural landscape or region in a live Minecraft Java
  world — terrain, landforms, biomes, water, natural scenery, named natural
  wonders, and designed caves. Sequences the terrain leaf skills and threads one
  shared coherence context (one datum, one continuous recipe, one palette, one
  biome+scatter plan, one integration pass) so the result reads as one coherent
  place. Use for canyons, mountains, islands, coastlines, river valleys, forests,
  cave systems, and recreations of natural wonders. Tier-2 orchestrator.

# build-natural-world (Tier-2 orchestrator)

You are a **specialty orchestrator**: you do not place blocks or author terrain
yourself — you run a domain **playbook**, invoking Tier-3 leaf skills in order and
threading the **shared coherence context** between them so the pieces come
together. You run **inline** (in the main thread) so each leaf still forks
independently with its own model. Read `$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/orchestration/coherence.md`
and `$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/orchestration/workflow-spine.md` first — they
are the contract you enforce.

## What you own (the coherence context)

Derive these once from the actual site and pass them into every leaf:

- **one datum / sea_level** — the whole region works to it;
- **one continuous terrain recipe** — terrain is ONE sampler-graph `recipe.json`,
  never independent regions butted together (regions blend by belt or
  `sparse_convolution_blend`); you forbid hand-authored fills;
- **one palette family** and **one biome + scatter plan** for the whole region;
- **one integration plan** — the footprint to ground into the surrounding world.

## The playbook

Run the spine (depth-scaled to the request — a small tweak is a shallow pass, the
gates never drop):

1. **survey-site** — read the actual terrain/biomes/datum. Always.
2. **survey-research** — if a named/real place (a specific canyon, coastline,
   wonder), pull `$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/terrain/research.md` facts first.
3. **exec-plan** — resolve requirements into `plan.toon` (header carries the
   coherence context).
4. **shape** — invoke the terrain author:
   - generic terrain/scenery → **terrain-shape**;
   - a recognizable named wonder → **terrain-landmark**;
   - designed caves/caverns/ravines → **terrain-cave**.
   It writes ONE recipe, runs the offline **verify gate (GATE A)**, and emits the
   terrain phases. HALT and re-author if verify fails.
5. **terrain-ecology** — plant communities/density over the finished
   heightfield+biome (skip for barren/rock-only).
6. **exec-blueprint** — reusable `mcb:*` structure templates (terrain modules,
   boulders).
7. **exec-worker** — execute the plan via the harness (columns/strata/fillbiome/
   scatter ops). Verify every phase.
8. **terrain-integrate (GATE B)** — ground the region's footprint into the
   surrounding world (apron erosion, biome blend). Required.
9. **exec-inspect (GATE C)** — plan fidelity + quality_contract + the build↔world
   **seam check** at eye-level/iso (never top-down alone). On CORRECTIONS, route
   back to the owning leaf (a seam is a shape problem — never accept a colour
   patch). Reconcile: ecology must match the heightfield's actual slope/biome.
10. **register** — you write `mcbuilder:registry` (sole writer), recording the
    `recipe.json` path + the integration apron.
11. **exec-reflect** — drafted lessons; you persist them to memory.

## Coherence reconciliation (catch the disjointedness)

After each leaf returns, check it against the shared context before advancing:
terrain↔ecology (no forests on cliffs), region↔region (one continuous field),
whole↔world (one integration pass). Mismatch → fix the owning leaf and re-run.

Closing a canyon/valley end is a region↔region continuity case, so route it back
through the SAME generator that authored the walls — never a different per-column
process. A headwall built from per-column random tops or per-column gully/notch
reads as a vertical dripping curtain; a smooth formula bowl between rough eroded
walls reads as pasted-in. The terrain-shape author closes the end with the same
cross-section (walls converge / pinch shut), the same `add_fbm` sampled at GLOBAL
coordinates (identical seeds, so the noise phase aligns at the seam), the same
`erode_thermal`/`erode_hydraulic`, then the same materializer — see
`$PLUGIN_ROOT/tools/terrain/close.py` (`close_belt_end`). Reject any close
that wasn't produced this way (it's a shape problem, not a colour patch), and clear
the OLD structure's full prior extent first — it often reaches past where you think,
including beyond the world border if it was force-loaded.

A user visual checkpoint is the gate for hero terrain; under autonomy, the
eye-level `exec-inspect` pass is the minimum substitute. Never judge terrain from
a top-down render alone.

Gate any expensive or hard-to-undo pass on an offline preview before it writes to
the world: a re-materialize, a large recolor, an end-close, or any pass that has
already failed once. Render it offline from the field/model (no world writes), get
user sign-off, then place once. One previewed proposal turns a place-render-revert
thrash into a single clean placement; it is far cheaper than the round-trip.
