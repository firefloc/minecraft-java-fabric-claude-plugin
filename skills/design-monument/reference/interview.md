# The adaptive interview

Pin down the piece without over-asking. Ask in small grouped batches through the host's
question interface (the multiple-choice ones use the structured options the host
offers), skip what is already clear, and record answers in `requirements.md`.

## Question bank

1. **Category** — a statue / figure, an organic creature, an abstract
   sculpture, pixel art or a mural, or large text / a logo? This routes the
   technique.
2. **Subject & source** — what is it; is it a real-world monument, a
   pop-culture creature, a reproduction of an image, or an original? A named
   subject triggers `survey-research`.
3. **Scale tier** — small (a few blocks — a yard ornament), medium (10–30 m),
   large (50–100 m), or extra-large (100 m+). Extra-large triggers the
   Java-envelope conversation (Y -64 to 320; scale down, or split the base off).
4. **Pose / composition** — for a figure or creature: standing, seated,
   coiled, winged, in motion. For a mural: wall-mounted or floor.
5. **Site & anchor** — anchor coordinates from the survey-site; standalone, on a
   building, on a hill, against a cliff, on a base wall.
6. **Solid or shell** — solid (small pieces) or hollow shell (large pieces);
   never habitable.
7. **Palette & finish** — the material look: marble, weathered bronze/copper,
   granite, painted colour, metallic. Pristine or weathered.
8. **Detail level** — blockwork only, or armor-stand detailing and accent
   figures?
9. **Project name** — the registry slug.

## Conditional follow-ups

- A named monument or creature → invoke `survey-research` for dimensions and
  reference images.
- Extra-large (a 200 m+ statue) → offer a reduced scale, or splitting the
  pedestal/plinth off to `design-building` / `terrain-shape` so the figure
  itself stays 1:1.
- Carved into a cliff (a Rushmore-style request) → confirm there is a cliff,
  or hand `terrain-landmark` / `terrain-shape` the job of making one first.
- A figure on a pedestal → confirm whether the pedestal is habitable (a
  `design-building` handoff) or a plain plinth.
- Pixel art / a logo → ask for the source image and the wanted block size;
  decide flat or low-relief.
- An animated piece (a fountain, a moving mobile) → hand the mechanism to the
  `system-redstone`.

## Iterate and suggest

For a vague request ("a cool statue for my courtyard"), **suggest options** —
name a couple of subjects and scales that fit the site and ask which appeals.
Propose; do not just interrogate.

## Conduct

- Lead with the category and subject — they pick the technique.
- Group questions; never interrogate line by line.
- Restate the piece — subject, scale, pose, palette — before rendering
  blueprints, so a misread is cheap to fix.
