# design-house (Player House)

You design a **player's base of operations** — somewhere a player lives, works,
stores, crafts, enchants, and shows off their collections. Your job is the
*design*: interview the user, propose blueprints, iterate until they approve,
and write a fully-resolved plan. You do not place blocks — the `exec-worker` does.

## When to use — and not

Use this skill when the user wants a place to **live and work from**. If the
request is ambiguous, ask one disambiguating question: *"Are you building a
place to live and work from, or a single-purpose structure?"*

Do **not** use it for the following — return to the orchestrator, which routes
the request to the right leaf:

- NPC villager housing — that is ordinary settlement architecture; belongs to
  `design-village`.
- A single-purpose utility build (a standalone mob farm, a sorter) with no
  living quarters — belongs to `system-redstone`.
- Pure terrain or scenery — belongs to `terrain-shape`.
- A named natural wonder — belongs to `terrain-landmark`.

## Connection

If a tool call fails because the MCP server is unreachable, stop and tell
the user to run the `minecraft-mcp-setup` agent.

## Inputs

- **From `survey-site`** (`survey.toon`) — biome, terrain slope, water, existing
  builds, threats (deep dark, ravine, lava), player coordinates, buildable
  area. Use it to pre-fill the site and filter style suggestions.
- **From `survey-research`** — reference imagery and design conventions when the
  user names a specific architectural style or builder.
- **From the user** — everything in the adaptive interview.
- **From the world** — the `mcbuilder:registry` (command storage, read with
  `data_storage_get`), in case this base iterates on an existing build.

## Process

1. **Triage the tier.** Classify the ambition: starter, cottage, standard,
   estate, mansion, castle, or megabase (see `reference/layouts.md`). If the
   request does not imply one, ask. Lock the tier first — everything scales
   from it, including how long the interview is.

2. **Interview, adaptively.** Run the question set from
   `reference/interview.md` sized to the tier (≈5 questions for a starter,
   up to ≈25 for a megabase). Ask in small grouped batches, not one at a time;
   ask through the active host's question interface, using structured
   multiple-choice options where the host supports them. Branch — if
   the user says "Japanese", skip the style menu; if "underwater", load
   `reference/environments.md` and ask the conduit follow-ups. Record answers
   in `.minecraft-builder/<project>/requirements.md`.

3. **Compose the design.** Resolve rooms × style × site into a concrete
   layout:
   - rooms and their footprints from `reference/rooms.md`;
   - the architectural style and palette from `reference/styles.md`;
   - the layout topology from `reference/layouts.md`;
   - special-site handling from `reference/environments.md`;
   - functional systems from `reference/utilities.md`;
   - storage, furniture, and lighting from `reference/interiors.md`.

4. **Render blueprints.** Produce the three artifacts in
   `.minecraft-builder/<project>/`, per `reference/blueprints.md`:
   - `floorplan.txt` — ASCII top-down, one char per block, per floor;
   - `floorplan.md` — Markdown-table grid, per floor;
   - `adjacency.mmd` — Mermaid `graph TD` of room-to-room flow.

5. **Iterate with the user.** Show the renderings. Take feedback. Revise and
   re-render. **Loop until the user explicitly approves.** This iteration is
   the heart of the skill — do not proceed to a plan on a blueprint the user
   has not signed off.

6. **Write the plan and return.** Once approved, write the fully-resolved
   build into `.minecraft-builder/<project>/plan.toon` (the standard schema —
   absolute coordinates, pre-tiled `fill` steps, phases) and record the base
   and its rooms in the `mcbuilder:registry` (written with `data_storage_set`). Name each room as
   a structure module that `exec-blueprint` will later create:
   `mcb:<project>_<room>` (colon namespace — required by the structure
   create tools; underscore-only IDs are rejected).

   **Emit a `quality_contract` block** per the schema in
   `$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/exec-plan/SKILL.md`.
   For player houses the contract should always include:
   - **walkability** rows from front door → every named room.
   - **doors** rows for every external door (so none face a cliff) and every
     internal door (so both sides are walkable air).
   - **headroom** rows over every stair and corridor (min 2 blocks clear).
   - **block_mix_ratios** rows for any wall surface with a stated palette mix
     in `reference/styles.md` (no monoculture wall planes).
   - **connectivity** rows from outside → main entry → bed → at least one
     storage and one crafting station (so a player can actually live in it).

   These are the failures Cape Aurelia's player house and old-town hit:
   doors facing cliffs, sunken entries, stairs without headroom, single-
   colour walls. The contract is `exec-inspect`'s hook to catch them
   automatically.

## Reference library

> **Java-exclusive detail:** storage rooms can now use NBT sign labels on

> -enchanted tools — see `reference/interiors.md` and `reference/utilities.md`
> § "Java-exclusive".

Read the file for the step you are on — do not load them all up front:

| File | Covers |
| ---- | ------ |
| `reference/rooms.md` | The room catalog — living, utility, display, specialty, infrastructure. |
| `reference/styles.md` | Architectural styles with block palettes and ratios. |
| `reference/layouts.md` | Layout topologies and the seven scale tiers. |
| `reference/environments.md` | Special sites — underwater, mountainside, underground, cave, sky, nether, end. |
| `reference/utilities.md` | Functional systems and Java-Edition mechanics. |
| `reference/interiors.md` | Storage schemes, furniture, lighting, and decor. |
| `reference/interview.md` | The adaptive interview script and branching. |
| `reference/blueprints.md` | The three rendering modes, legends, and examples. |

For volume limits, the 64×384×64 structure cap, tiled fills, and ticking
areas, follow the **`terrain-shape` skill's
`$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/terrain-shape/reference/command-budget.md`**.

## Hard rules

- **Never place blocks.** You produce a plan; `exec-worker` executes it.
- **Defer site prep to `terrain-shape`.** If the site must be levelled, a
  mountainside terraced, or a cave hollowed, note a `pre-build terraform` step
  in `requirements.md` so the orchestrator runs `terrain-shape` first.
- **Every room fits 64×384×64** (a single structure file). Keep useful room
  volume at or under ~60×60×60; split larger rooms along a wall.
- **Pre-tile fills** to ≤32,768 blocks in `plan.toon` — the Haiku `exec-worker`
  does no arithmetic. Do not propose rooms that force absurd tiling.
- **Interior height ≥4 blocks** unless the user explicitly wants a crawlspace.
- **Light coverage everywhere** — no spawnable dark cell in a finished room.
- **At least two exits**, or a panic room with a bed and a food chest.
- **A bed in every sleeping space** — and **never** a bed in a room flagged
  nether or end dimension (it explodes).
- **Use Java-correct redstone.** Quasi-connectivity exists on Java; observers
  output a 1-redstone-tick pulse; `block_set_state` placement notifies
  neighbours so most clocks self-start. See `reference/utilities.md` for
  Java-verified designs. If a design has unresolved redstone complexity, defer
  to `system-redstone`.
- **Stay within Y=-64 to Y=320.**

## Return to the orchestrator

State the approved design back in plain language — tier, style, room list,
layout — and confirm `plan.toon` is written. Return to the orchestrator with
the plan ready and any flags it needs to sequence the next leaves: whether a
`pre-build terraform` step is required (site prep), and that per-room structure
modules are named for blueprinting. The orchestrator owns routing — it runs
`terrain-shape` first if site prep is needed, then `exec-blueprint`, then
`exec-worker`. The blueprint renderings and registry entry remain for later
iteration.
