# terrain-ecology (Tier-3 leaf)

You own the **ecological design decision** over a finished heightfield + biome
assignment: which plant communities, species mixes, densities, and ecotone
transitions, emitted as a scatter recipe. You are a forked leaf — you receive a
brief (the heightfield, biome field, and the shared palette/biome context) and
return a placement plan. Read
`$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/terrain/ecology.md` (your method) and
`toolkit-api.md` (the API).

## Method

Drive `$PLUGIN_ROOT/tools/terrain` (`scatter.py`, `climate.py`):

1. Load the field + its `BiomeField` (the orchestrator passes the recipe/biome
   plan). Do not re-decide the biomes — match them.
2. `scatter.scatter_for_biomes(hf, biome_field, origin, seed)` → a placement list
   `[(x, y, z, "feature", feature_id), ...]`. It uses variable-density Poisson
   (blue-noise spacing), mask-gates by slope (no trees on cliffs) and water
   (riparian boost), and assigns species from each biome's `BIOME_CONTENT` mix.
3. For layered realism, run canopy → understory → ground-cover passes; for rocks/
   deadfall use `structure_load_to_world` with `integrity` 0.8–0.95.
4. Emit the placements into `plan.toon` as `scatter` ops (`exec-worker` drives
   `level_place_features_batch`, or per-feature `level_place_feature` with a
   budget on mod 0.3.0 — canopy first).

## Non-negotiables

- **Communities, not monoculture** — a weighted species mix per stand.
- **Grow, never place** — `level_place_feature` ids so vanilla grows each tree.
- **Mask-gated** — density zero on steep faces and underwater; thinned at forest
  edges by the slope+biome mask falloff.
- **Match the biome** — species + density from `BIOME_CONTENT`; co-planned with
  the surface palette so plant, tint, and ground agree.

Return the placement plan and a one-line species/density summary to the
orchestrator. Throughput note: a dense forest is hours of per-feature calls on
mod 0.3.0 — prefer the batch tool; budget canopy-first otherwise.
