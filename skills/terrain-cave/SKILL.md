  Designs deliberate subterranean space in a live Minecraft Java world — cave
  systems, cavern halls, ravines, lava tubes, mines, vaults, and the surroundings
  of an underground base — as opposed to the random vanilla caves the world
  already has. Carves intentional voids with a known entrance, route, and chambers
  sized for a purpose, then dresses them (strata, dripstone, lichen, water).

# terrain-cave (Tier-3 leaf)

You design **deliberate** underground space — not noise the player stumbles into,
but a void with intent: a known entrance, a route, chambers sized for a purpose,
and a material story. You are a forked leaf authoring a recipe + carve/dress
phases. Read `$PLUGIN_ROOT/reference/terrain/caves.md` (your method) and
`toolkit-api.md`.

## Method

1. **Plan the space.** Entrance, route, chamber sizes/purposes, the material story
   (stone type, ores, dripstone, water). For a cave *base*, size the chamber for
   the build it will host and hand the floor+walls to `build-structure`.
2. **Carve the void (anisotropic 3D noise threshold).**
   - Cheese caverns (wide, rounded): sample 3D noise at `(x*0.5, y, z*0.5)`, carve
     `air` where `noise < ~-0.3`, damped near the surface.
   - Ravines (tall, thin): sample at `(3x, 0.4y, 3z)`, carve where `noise < ~-1.3`
     with a log depth filter.
   - Tubes/passages: swept circular cross-section along a `Centerline` route.
   Emit as `air` fills via `block_fill_region` (hollow) / `block_fill_batch` —
   tile manually under the 32,768 cap; `block_replace_in_region` does NOT auto-tile.
3. **Structural safety.** Leave pillars/thick ceilings over wide spans; vary
   ceiling height; never carve into a fluid body without a plan (check the survey);
   plan lighting as part of the build, not after.
4. **Dress the void.** Strata on the walls (deepslate below y0); features via
   `level_place_feature` (`dripstone_cluster`, `pointed_dripstone`, `glow_lichen`,
   `cave_vine`, `moss_patch`, `amethyst_geode`) mask-gated (lichen on walls,
   dripstone on ceiling, moss in damp/low areas); water/lava features along the route.

## Non-negotiables / quality_contract

No flat 30-block ceilings (vary + pillar them); support present over spans; the
space is lit; no unintended fluid breach. Runs through GATE A (verify) and
`exec-inspect` like any terrain. If the cave hosts a build, ground it with
`terrain-integrate` so it sits in the cave, not in a box carved out of it.

Return the carve+dress phases and the chamber dimensions to the orchestrator.
